  <h3>Async Components</h3>
  <p>
    Sometimes the application start has to be delayed until some <strong>asynchronous tasks</strong> will be finished, for example until the connection with the database will be established.
    That's why Nest provides a way to create <strong>async components</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To create an async component, we're using the <code>useFactory</code>. The factory must return <code>Promise</code> or just be marked as an <code>async</code> function.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-typescript">{{ asyncComponent }}</code></pre>

  <p>
    These asynchronous components might be simply injected to other components by the token.
    Each component, which depends on the async components will be instantiated when the async component would be <strong>already resolved</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The above example is for demonstration purposes.
