  <h3>Providers</h3>
  <p>
    Basically, almost everything may be considered as a provider â€“ service, repository, factory, helper, and so on. All
    of them
    can <strong>inject</strong> dependencies through <code>constructor</code>, meaning, they can create various
    relationships
    with each other. But in fact, a provider is nothing else than just a simple class annotated with an <code>@Injectable()</code>
    decorator.

  <p>
    In the previous chapter, we have built a simple <code>CatsController</code>. Controllers shall handle HTTP requests
    and
    delegate more complex tasks to the <strong>services</strong>. The providers are plain JavaScript classes with an
    <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator
    on top of them.

  <h4>Services</h4>
  <p>
    Let's start by creating a simple <code>CatsService</code> provider.
  </p>
  <span class="filename">
    {{ 'cats.service' | extension: catsServiceT.isJsActive }}
    <app-tabs #catsServiceT></app-tabs>
  </span>
  <pre [class.hide]="catsServiceT.isJsActive"><code class="language-typescript">{{ catsService }}</code></pre>
  <pre [class.hide]="!catsServiceT.isJsActive"><code class="language-typescript">{{ catsServiceJs }}</code></pre>
  <blockquote class="info">
    <strong>Hint</strong>
    To create a service using CLI, simply execute <code>$ nest g service cats/cats</code> command.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Here's a <code>CatsService</code>, a basic class with one property and two methods. The only new trait is that it
    uses
    the <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator. The <code>@Injectable()</code> attaches the metadata, thereby Nest knows
    that
    this class is a Nest provider. Notice that there is a <code>Cat</code> interface used above. We didn't mention it
    because
    the schema is exactly same as in the <code>CreateCatDto</code> class which we have created in the previous chapter.
    <p>
      Since we have the service class already done, let's use it inside the <code>CatsController</code>:
    </p>
    <span class="filename">
      {{ 'cats.controller' | extension: catsServiceT.isJsActive }}
      <app-tabs #catsControllerT></app-tabs>
    </span>
    <pre [class.hide]="catsControllerT.isJsActive"><code class="language-typescript">{{ catsController }}</code></pre>
    <pre [class.hide]="!catsControllerT.isJsActive"><code class="language-typescript">{{ catsControllerJs }}</code></pre>
    <p>
      The <code>CatsService</code> is injected through the class constructor. Don't be afraid of the <code>private readonly</code>
      shortened
      syntax. It means that we've created and initialized the <code>catsService</code> member immediately in the same
      location.
    </p>
    <h4>Dependency injection</h4>
    <p>
      Nest is built around the strong design pattern commonly known as <strong>Dependency injection</strong>. We
      recommend
      to read a great article about this concept in the official <a href="https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection"
        target="blank">Angular</a>
      documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Nest, thanks to the <strong>TypeScript</strong> capabilities, it's extremely easy to manage dependencies
      because
      they will be resolved just by type and afterward, passed to your controller's constructor:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-typescript">{{ constructorSyntax }}</code></pre>
    <h4>Custom providers</h4>
    <p>
      An inversion of control container, that Nest makes use of to resolve relationships between providers, is far more
      powerful
      than described above. The <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator is only a tip of an iceberg, not strictly required
      to define providers. Instead, you can use plain values, classes, either asynchronous or synchronous factories.
      Look
      <a routerLink="/fundamentals/dependency-injection">here</a> to find more examples.
    </p>
    <h4>Optional providers</h4>
    <p>
      Occasionally, you might face relations which do not necessarily have to be resolved. For instance, your class may
      depend
      on a <strong>configuration object</strong>, but if none was passed, the default values should be used. In such
      case, the relation becomes optional, because lack of the configuration provider wouldn't lead to errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ensure that provider isn't required, use <code>@Optional()</code> decorator in the <code>constructor</code>
      signature.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-typescript">{{ optional }}</code></pre>
    <h4>Property-based injection</h4>
    <p>
      In some very specific cases, a property-based injection might be useful. For instance, if your top-level class
      depends on either one or multiple providers, passing them all the way up by calling <code>super()</code>
      in sub-classes from the constructor can be very annoying. Thus, in order to avoid it, you can use <code>@Inject()</code>
      decorator on
      a property level.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-typescript">{{ propertyInjection }}</code></pre>
    <blockquote class="warning">
      <strong>Warning</strong>
      If your class doesn't extend any other provider, you should always prefer using
      <strong>constructor-based</strong>
      injection.
    </blockquote>
    <h4>Provider registration</h4>
    <p>
      The last thing is to tell the module that something called <code>CatsService</code> truly exists. We do this by
      editing
      our module file - <code>app.module.ts</code>, and put the service into the <code>providers</code> array of the
      <code>@Module()</code> decorator.
    </p>
    <span class="filename">
      {{ 'app.module' | extension: appModuleT.isJsActive }}
      <app-tabs #appModuleT></app-tabs>
    </span>
    <pre><code class="language-typescript">{{ appModule }}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Thanks to that, Nest will be able to resolve the dependencies of the <code>CatsController</code> class. This is
      how
      our directory structure looks right now:
    </p>
    <div class="file-tree">
      <div class="item">src</div>
      <div class="children">
        <div class="item">cats</div>
        <div class="children">
          <div class="item">dto</div>
          <div class="children">
            <div class="item">create-cat.dto.ts</div>
          </div>
          <div class="item">interfaces</div>
          <div class="children">
            <div class="item">cat.interface.ts</div>
          </div>
          <div class="item">cats.service.ts</div>
          <div class="item">cats.controller.ts</div>
        </div>
        <div class="item">app.module.ts</div>
        <div class="item">main.ts</div>
      </div>
    </div>
</div>
